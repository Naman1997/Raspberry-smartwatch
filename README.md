This is a college project that I made using a raspberry pi and some python. Functionalities of the project include: 

  - Ability to read messages you recieve on your phone on the smartwatch(Raspberry Pi)
  - Ability to read .txt files
  - Read your phone's sensor data
  - Estimate number of steps you've taken
  - And most importantly, execute shell commands remotely from your smartphone to your linux based smartwatch/laptop!
